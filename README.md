VERSION HISTORY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0 (2015.02.22)
 All 8 scripts were added. 
 - loadfile: It contains example files for running scripts.
 - ANN_model: This script constructs ANN and DBN networks. 
 Feedforward neural network and stochastic gradient descent.
 - SetValues: This class initiates all the default values including inputs, 
 outputs, weight and biases
 - errortools: Visual plotting and error calculation. 
 MSE, Pearson r, and correlation plot.
 - ANNforClass: ANN model to solve classification problem
 - ANNforCurvefit: ANN model to solve curve-fitting problem (regression)
 - DBNforClass: DBN model to solve classification problem
 - DBNforCurvefit: DBN model to solve curve-fitting problem (regression)

1.1 (2015.03.07)
 - In classification, prediction for accuracy bug fixed.

1.2 (2015.04.30)
 - ANN scripts that runnable in python2 is moved to 'VersionHistory' folder. (refer to for_python2.zip file)
 - Main scripts are re-written in order to run it in python3. From now on, ANN script is only supportable in python3.
